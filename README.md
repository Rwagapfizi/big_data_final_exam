# Obesity Analysis Final Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes factors contributing to obesity using interview-based data. It includes:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python (Jupyter)
- Visual analytics in Power BI
- Cleaned and raw datasets
- A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the findings

## Methodology

- **Data Source**: CSV data collected via interviews.
- **Cleaning**: Handled missing values, converted Yes/No to 1/0.
- **Analysis**: Performed using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
- **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards in Power BI.

## Power BI Dashboard

- **Page 1: Data from Interview**
  - Pie charts for Yes/No responses
  - Bar charts for frequency-type questions
  - Filters for obesity categories and age

- **Page 2: Data from Analysis**
  - Obesity category distribution
  - Insights and patterns identified during analysis
  - Use of BMI as patterns insight
